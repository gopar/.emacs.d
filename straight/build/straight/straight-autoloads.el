(autoload 'straight-remove-unused-repos "straight" "\
Remove unused repositories from the repos and build directories.
A repo is considered \"unused\" if it was not explicitly requested via
`straight-use-package' during the current Emacs session.

(autoload 'straight-get-recipe "straight" "\
Interactively select a recipe from one of the recipe repositories.
All recipe repositories in `straight-recipe-repositories' will
first be cloned. After the recipe is selected, it will be copied
to the kill ring. With a prefix argument, first prompt for a
recipe repository to search. Only that repository will be
cloned.

From Lisp code, SOURCES should be a subset of the symbols in
`straight-recipe-repositories'. Only those recipe repositories
are cloned and searched. If it is nil or omitted, then the value
of `straight-recipe-repositories' is used. If SOURCES is the
symbol `interactive', then the user is prompted to select a
recipe repository, and a list containing that recipe repository
is used for the value of SOURCES. ACTION may be `copy' (copy
recipe to the kill ring), `insert' (insert at point), or nil (no
action, just return it).

Optional arg FILTER must be a unary function.
It takes a package name as its sole argument.
If it returns nil the candidate is excluded.

Register, clone, build, and activate a package and its dependencies.
This is the main entry point to the functionality of straight.el.

MELPA-STYLE-RECIPE is either a symbol naming a package, or a list
whose car is a symbol naming a package and whose cdr is a
property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

Return non-nil when package is initially installed, nil otherwise.

Test straight.el in a clean environment.
ARGS may be any of the following keywords and their respective values:
  - :pre-bootstrap (Form)...
      Forms evaluated before bootstrapping straight.el
      e.g. (setq straight-repository-branch \"develop\")
      Note this example is already in the default bootstrapping code.

  - :post-bootstrap (Form)...
      Forms evaluated in the testing environment after boostrapping.
      e.g. (straight-use-package \\='(example :type git :host github))

  - :interactive Boolean
      If nil, the subprocess will immediately exit after the test.
      Output will be printed to `straight-bug-report--process-buffer'
      Otherwise, the subprocess will be interactive.

  - :preserve Boolean
      If non-nil, the test directory is left in the directory stored in the
      variable `temporary-file-directory'. Otherwise, it is
      immediately removed after the test is run.

  - :executable String
      Indicate the Emacs executable to launch.
      Defaults to the path of the current Emacs executable.

  - :raw Boolean
      If non-nil, the raw process output is sent to
      `straight-bug-report--process-buffer'. Otherwise, it is
      formatted as markdown for submitting as an issue.

  - :user-dir String
      If non-nil, the test is run with `user-emacs-directory' set to STRING.
      Otherwise, a temporary directory is created and used.
      Unless absolute, paths are expanded relative to the variable
      `temporary-file-directory'.
