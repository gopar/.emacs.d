This is a directory for custom modes that I made.

Most of these modes are just things that I believe are too small or irrelevant to be packages.
I only created them because they help me with my everyday programming.

If there's interest in a certain package or more then I might consider releasing them to MELPA
or allowing anyone to grab the code and work on it. Whatever floats your boat.
