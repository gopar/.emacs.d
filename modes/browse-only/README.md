# Browse Only Mode

When this global mode is activated, you can only enter files in `read-only-mode`.
This is useful for me since whenever I enter a new codebase, I browse around
and don't want to accidentally type/save something.a

You can simply exit the mode in an individual file by `M-x read-only-mode`.
